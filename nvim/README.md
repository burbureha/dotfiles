[x] When cmp finds result in LSP after hitting <CR> it doesn't complete what's inside the parenthesis.

[x] Snippets are not expanding

[x] Try to get rid of matching pair and run profiling again with ':help vim.cmd'

[x] LSP over BUFFER

[x] Terminal should stay in one directory

[x] Nvim-tree on directories

[x] resizing splits

[x] terminal should close on ZZ

[x] if opening something like .config/nvim - nvim-tree doesn't open

[x] <C-t> should open terminal in nvim-tree

[x] telescope should parse diretctory opened in nvim-tree

[x]complete LSP config

[x] Snippets are bad with indenting in c++

[x] It's LSP config, Error in non git file looks bad

------------------------------TODO----------------------------------------------------
[] Error while typing should be also dysplayed

[] Hover over error and display it, LSP configuration

[] I should hit <TAB> before it starts showing me completion, it shouldn't be like that

[] comments

[] telescope should not open in NvimTree-1, but in different buffer -- probably hard :(

[] Rust analyzer takes too much time and space to setup, as a metric use noria repo
    "rust-analyzer.cachePriming.numThreads"
    "rust-analyzer.cachePriming.enable"
    "rust-analyzer.lru.capacity"
    "rust-analyzer.cargo.buildScripts.enable"

[] When resizing nvim-tree new size should stay after switching buffers (not buffers, but when opening file inside nvim-tree)

[] When going to defenitions of objects, nvim-tree should open directory of file where definition is

[] When updating packer, if treesitter fails, TSUpdate <language> should be automatic

[] Add shortcut to your nvim config

[] lukas-reineke/indent-blankline.nvim something wrong with it "|" symbol sometimes just deletes text

[] Prettier

[] Install tool for merge conflicts

------------------------------Plugins ideas--------------------------------------------
[] Generate 'help' pages on the fly for libraries that you are using
[] Make normal symbols viewer, like on github
