If you struggling with miniscule fonts I kind of solved it

1) First of all install font-awesome
        yay -S ttf-line-awesome
        yay -S awesome-terminal-fonts

2) Update you font system path
        fc-cache -f -v

3) Change you config.h file in dwm directory, (You can keep you original font that you like, 
   you just need to add new additional font awesome)
        static const char *fonts[] = { "UbuntuMono-R:size=10", "fontawesome-regular:size=10"};
        
4) Go to https://www.nerdfonts.com/cheat-sheet and search for glyphs that starts with "nf-fa", 
   in my experience other glyphs still will look very small

5) Pick glyphs you like put them in your tags array

6) Recompile your build of dwm
        sudo make clean install

Done :)
